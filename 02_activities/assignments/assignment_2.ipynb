    "For Assignment 1, which focused on implementing a \"Missing Number\" function, I began by carefully analyzing the problem to identify the most efficient approach. I considered various strategies, including mathematical formulas and bit manipulation, but ultimately settled on using a summation approach for its simplicity and efficiency. I wrote the function step by step, ensuring that I tested it on edge cases like arrays with a single missing number or an empty array. The thrill of seeing the function work correctly for all test cases made the process even more rewarding.\n",

I suggested some improvements, including optimizing memory usage and refining how duplicates are detected. We also talked about potential edge cases that needed to be addressed. This collaborative review process was invaluable, as it deepened my understanding of tree structures and helped me refine my ability to critique and offer constructive feedback.\n",
